<h2>Kendall Olson</h2>
<h2>Client Report</h2>
<p>Q1: I chose the images and content for my website through the use of AI as well as 
sourcing royalty free images from the internet. <br>
Q2:I communicated to the lead through discord and in person without issue.<br>
Q3: The lead met my expectations for the home page. I really like the website so far but the reserve page was never completed<br>
Q4: I would make sure the team I hire has clear communication for next time so that I can get 
a full-complete site.

<p>Q1: I communicated to my team in person and via email. <br>
Q2:I communicated to the client in person and on discord. There was no issue.<br>
Q3: It went fine, I have published pages and links before so I had experience.<br>
Q4: Managing the site and making it went well. I just think I needed better communication with my team.

<h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
<p>Q1: I didn't have nor really needed a way to communicate on the ricks project pages. The lead gave 
me all the info I needed. For the other page, I had to email my lead for the siteplan as well as ask him to 
publish the link in the repo for Landon's site. I am still waiting for the link. <br>
Q2: Like I mentioned briefly before, I knew exactly what to do for the ricks project page. 
For the other page, I had to email my lead for the siteplan and even then the site plan was vague.<br>
Q3: I was able to contribute to both sites and present a finished product. It matched the site plan and themes
made by the lead developer.<br>
Q4: I had no issues accessing the repositories from github and I was able to push my changes without issue. But,
I am still waiting on my lead to publish the page and link for landon's site.
